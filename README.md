Rice BIOE 421/521 Final Project


Brainstormed Idea for Final Project Team 02: Pancake Patrol 
Sergio Gonzalez and Nimish Mittal
The team will aim to build an electronic keypad-access device that will store a passcode and unlock a door if the correct password is inputted.
The initial goal will be to read the signals from a keypad on an Arduino, and build a program that can store a password and compare it to the inputted combination.
Later iterations will attach a motor to a key and lock, add sound features, execute a lock-out feature after multiple failed inputs, and allow for password resets.

A key can be inconvenient to carry, is prone to being lost, and does not allow for a group of people to have access. 
A keypad on the other hand, simply requires knowing the passcode and can let many people have access.
The team will aim to build an electronic keypad-access device that will mount on a door. 
The device will be attached to the door’s lock mechanism and unlock the door if the correct passcode is inputted. 
The device will consist of a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi or Arduino), a motor (stepper or servo), a keypad (wired to the microcontroller), a speaker, and a turning mechanism between the motor and door lock.
On the first initialization, the user can input the desired passcode. 
The microcontroller reads the signals from a keypad and has a program that can store the passcode for comparison with other inputted combinations. 
The primary function of the device will be to accept passcode combinations and either accept them or reject them. 
An acceptance will lead to the program executing a function to unlock the door. 
A rejection will deny entry and leave the door locked. 
As a secondary feature, the door locks out the user and sounds an alarm if too many incorrect passcodes are inputted. 
This will serve as a safety measure. 
Additionally, the device will have a reset function that will allow a user with the passcode to reset the passcode.
